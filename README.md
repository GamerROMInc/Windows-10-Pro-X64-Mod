BEFORE YOU GET STARTED:

To get started you will need the following files/hardware to install this version of Windows 10 Pro for the ASUS PRIME Z590-P/Z590 Motherboard/Chipset.

- Rufus/balenaEtcher USB Flashers (Use 1 of them): Get Rufus: https://rufus.ie/en/ | Get balenaEtcher: https://www.balena.io/etcher/

- Windows 10 Pro v1 x64 PRIME Z590-P Stock GPU iso: https://archive.org/details/win-10-pro-v-1-x-64-prime-z-590-p-stock-gpu-driver

- ASUS PRIME Z590-P Motherboard with an Intel i7 10700KF 3.80GHz CPU intalled (this may work on other CPU(s) even w/out our recommendations)

- USB flash drive with at least 8GB of free space

if you fail to meet the requirements the OS may still install but you may suffer unexpected issues (these changes will change in later updates).


WHAT IS THIS & WHATS THE PURPOSE OF THIS?

You just built your very own PC, or you upgraded to a Z590/Z590-P chipset (PRIME Z590-P/Z590 Motherboard) and you are lazy to install the latest drivers for your motherboard, well you don't have too, just install as normal and your done no need to look at the manufacture for drivers unless specified to do so. We do recommend to install the RST driver for your M.2 witch you can always check to see if any drivers are outdated here: https://www.asus.com/us/motherboards-components/motherboards/prime/prime-z590-p/HelpDesk_knowledge/

This build also includes the "UCMCLIENT" driver that microsoft cant find unless you use 3rd party driver installers, nither ASUS provides the driver for this built-in hardware component. This build also removes bloatware from installing and they cannot reinstall no matter what unless you manually choose too. This build includes the default basic media graphics driver they provide automatically and will install your GPU driver automatically.

This build also includes additional info in Windows 10's about setting of yout chipset and tech support etc to make it easy for you to find support for your motherboard. This build is our version of a OEM OS for the ASUS Z590-P Motherboard


HOW TO INSTALL:

To install use either Rufus or balenaEtcher flash the ISO for now we will use rufus since balenaEtcher does it already automatically.

On RUFUS plug in your usb flash drive (8GB) and then press the select button to load your ISO. Once your ISO has been loaded ensure the below options are set to "GPT" and "UEFI (non CSM)" and then the file system format is on "NTFS" then click start (this will take some time to do, so please wait) you will know its done it will make a sound and the progress bar will show as DONE.

Once its done turn off your PC, you can leave your USB plugged in, Once it's off turn your PC on and press the "DELETE" button on your keyboard to enter your motherboard bios. On the bottom right window you will see your flash drive with 2 partitions click on "Boot Menu (F8)" and choose the flash drive that has the "Partition 1" at the end, your system will reboot and attempt to boot from that drive you previously selected and start the install process. REMEMEBER: You may not need to enter a key, you will have to enter it when you complete the setup in the activation settings.


This project was compiled by using NTLite witch you yourself can contribute to the project https://www.ntlite.com/ we are looking into other chipsets you can submit your request via our business email and we can work togehter to support other motherboards and chipsets.
